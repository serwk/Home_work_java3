The success of Java and its write once, run anywhere concept has led to other similar efforts,
notably the .NET Framework, appearing since 2002, which incorporates many of the successful aspects of Java.
.NET was built from the ground-up to support multiple programming languages,
 while the Java platform was initially built to support only the Java language,
 although many other languages have been made for JVM since. Like Java,
 .NET languages compile to byte code and are executed by the Common Language Runtime (CLR),
 which is similar in purpose to the JVM. Like the JVM,
 the CLR provides memory management through automatic garbage collection,
 and allows .NET byte code to run on multiple operating systems.

.NET includes a Java-like language called Visual J# (formerly named J++) that is incompatible with the Java specification,
and the associated class library mostly dates to the old JDK 1.1 version of the language.
For these reasons, it is more of a transitional language to switch from Java to the .NET platform
than it is a first class .NET language. Visual J# was discontinued with the release of Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.
The existing version shipping with Visual Studio 2005 will be supported until 2015 as per the product life-cycle strategy.[citation needed]
