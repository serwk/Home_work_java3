See also: List of JVM languages and JVM programming languages
The word "Java", alone, usually refers to Java programming language that was designed for use with the Java platform.
Programming languages are typically outside of the scope of the phrase "platform",
although the Java programming language was listed as a core part of the Java platform before Java 7.
The language and runtime were therefore commonly considered a single unit. However,
an effort was made with the Java 7 specification to more clearly treat the Java language and
the Java virtual machine as separate entities, so that they are no longer considered a single unit.[23]

Third parties have produced many compilers or interpreters that target the JVM.
Some of these are for existing languages, while others are for extensions to the Java language.

These include:

BeanShell – A lightweight scripting language for Java[24]
Ceylon – An object-oriented, strongly statically typed programming language with an emphasis on immutability
Clojure – A modern, dynamic, and functional dialect of the Lisp programming language on the Java platform
Gosu – A general-purpose Java Virtual Machine-based programming language released under the Apache License 2.0
Groovy – A fully Java interoperable, Java-syntax-compatible, static and dynamic language with features from Python, Ruby, Perl, and Smalltalk
JRuby – A Ruby interpreter
Jython – A Python interpreter
Kotlin – An industrial programming language for JVM with full Java interoperability
Rhino – A JavaScript interpreter
Scala – A multi-paradigm programming language with non-Java compatible syntax designed as a "better Java"
